# Find safe places in JavaScript

### Getting started

- cd into project directory
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run tests:
  - run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
  - run tests once: `npm test`

### Requirements

For this exercise we will be using _Javascript_ and _nodejs_. For running the tests we need _Jest_ which has been automatically installed by _npm_.

To run the test, type in: `npm test` or for watch mode `npm run test:watch`.

### Creating the solution

There are two files for this challenge. One file holds the methods you have to implement to solve the challenge. It is located in `./src/savePlaces.js`.

The other file is holding the tests, with all requirements for this challenge. You can find them in the file `./test/savePlaces.test.js`.

For each function in the savePlaces.js there is a suite of Jest-tests with example input and expected results from the function in savePlaces.test.js.

__By defaults the tests are disabled. Please enable the tests by replacing 'xdescribe' with 'describe'__

### Running tests

To run the test:

```
npm test
```
