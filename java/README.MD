# Find safe places in Java

## Requirements

For this exercise we will use Java 8.
You need to have the JDK8 installed and added to your path.


## Running the tests

### Activating the tests
To activate the tests just delete the @Ignore annotation on each test method

The tests are grouped into 3 levels which each represent a method to be implemented
(see the comments before and after each group of tests) so you can implement and test each method
on its own

### Windows
To run the tests in a Windows environment navigate into the project directory 
and execute ```./gradlew.bat test```

### Linux/MacOS
To run test in a Linux or MacOS environment navigate into the project directory
and execute ```./gradlew test```
